# HTML CSS and JS way (pre react)

- We used to send html css and js from server to user
- Each time we go to subpage the files needed to be send once again
- We used DOM which was tree like strucutre
- jQuey was handling the cross browser issues
- as more and more js was used libs like backbone.js were born
- SPAs were born - we focus less on html and more on js. the website acts more like a desktop application. Where thejs changes the DOM
- angular.js allowed to create component like elements and help organize the app
- in 2013 fb releases react. To help with complexity/architecture issues
