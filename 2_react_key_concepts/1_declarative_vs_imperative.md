# Don't touch the DOM! React will do it

most libraries allowed to interact with the DOM, just in a simple fashion by swapping parts of the HTML in a simple fashion this way is called IMPERATIVE programming

# Imperative paradigm

imperative programming makes it hard to see relationship between the events like user clicked && is loged in.

DOM manipulation in the originall way is costly when it comes to time. It has to re-paint elements and re-calculate the flow of the document (width sizes and placment)

# declerative paradigm

React handles the DOM itself. React takes a description on how the app should look and finds best performant way of doing this.
