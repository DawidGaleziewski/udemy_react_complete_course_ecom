# react is a ui library. As it concerns itself only with UI. Other aspects of the web app have to be added via 3rd pary libraries. Unlike the angular that comes as a full package

# React is ui specific and can work on other platforms connecting to their apis like react native/react360 (for vr).

# This is why we also install react DOM with react library
